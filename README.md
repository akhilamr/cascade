# Neonatal-Sepsis Cascade Model

This repository hosts a reproducible Monte‑Carlo model that estimates how many neonates —
and how many suspected sepsis episodes — would be captured by point‑of‑care diagnostics
placed at four LMIC health‑system tiers.

See `src/cascade_model.py` for the core engine and `src/run_simulation.py`
for a CLI that generates tables and figures into the `outputs/` folder.
